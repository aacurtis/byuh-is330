  <h1>HTML Image Demo</h1>
    <!-- You can use images from a variety of sources. Use the <img> tag.
    If the image file is in the same location as the html file, you can use the <img src = "filename.jpg" > tag. -->
    
    <h2>Pointing to images hosted on another server</h2>
    <!-- You can also point to image content located on another server on the Internet.
    To do so, your src attribute of your <img> tag should include the URL of the image.  
    It will look like this -->
    
    <p><img src = "http://media.ldscdn.org/images/media-library/oceans/australia-coast-1059125-gallery.jpg" height = 200>
    
    <!--
    If you use this technique to link to images on sites you do not own, please make sure the site owner is okay with that. 
    -->
    <h2>Embedding images from an images hosting website</h2>
    <!--
    A variety of image hosting sites will also provide code for you to embed images from their website in your web page. 
    One example is flickr.com, a Yahoo! property.  If you search for and find an image you like, you can usually click 
    the share button (some sites labels this as an "embed" button), and a popup will appear with code to copy and paste
    into your HTML file. It will look like this
    -->
